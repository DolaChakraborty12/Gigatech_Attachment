Duration: 14 Days
Department: Research & Development (R&D)
Tasks Performed
During our internship, we focused on debugging and refining Bangla language processing tools and models. The tasks included:

**Bug Identification and Error Analysis**

Performed comprehensive bug identification on an existing Paraphrase Model (using the Bangladesh National Corpus).
Conducted error analysis to improve model performance and robustness.

**Parts of Speech (POS) Tagging**

Leveraged Bangla-based Transformer Models to perform POS tagging on Bangla text.
Focused on accurate tagging to enhance linguistic understanding for downstream tasks.

**Bangla News Headline Categorization**

Classified Bangla news headlines into predefined categories using advanced NLP models.
